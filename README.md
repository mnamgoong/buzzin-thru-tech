# Buzzin' Thru Tech
Final project for CS 2340 at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Spring 2023)

## Summary
Buzzin' Thru Tech is a rudimentary Android game modeled after Crossy Road.

## Inspiration
As students at Georgia Tech, we wanted to create a fun game for other students to play that integrates different aspects of campus into the design, making the game more relatable and thus more engaging.

## How to Play
1. Enter your name. Select a difficulty: Easy (3 lives), Medium (2 lives), or Hard (1 life). Choose a character: Buzz, President Cabrera, or Stinky CS Kid.
2. To move your character, press and fling your mouse in the desired direction.
3. Advance forward while avoiding the obstacles. Passing faster moving objects will award you with more points: bus (normal 50 points), Ramblin' Reck (60 points), and scooter (70 points).
4. When you reach the river, jump onto the logs to avoid falling in the water.
5. Successfully reach Tech Tower in order to win the game. Good luck!

## Challenges and Accomplishments
To create our project, we followed an iterative developmental process composed of five sprints throughout the semester. We faced many challenges, given that no one on our team had prior experience with Android development. Despite our big learning curve with Android Studio, we were succesfully able to create a working game with our envisioned, custom-made designs. We are very proud to have created Buzzin' Thru Tech from scratch, so please go check it out!
